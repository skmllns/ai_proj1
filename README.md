========

This program brute-forces a solution to the Travelling Salesman Problem (given x number of points, visit each one so as to traverse the shortest path).

Random7.tsp is a sample input file. It gives 7 sets of coordinates of points to be visited.

calcs.py contains the necessary calculations. main_tsp.py is the main file.

Using more than 10 sets of coordinates is not advised, as the computational complexity of the problem explodes around that point.

Dependencies:
Python 2.7, matplotlib
